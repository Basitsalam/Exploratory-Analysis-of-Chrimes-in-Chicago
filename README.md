# Exploratory-Analysis-of-Chrimes-in-Chicago
Data Cleaning, Wrangling and Exploratory Analysis of Crimes in Chicago 


This project will focus on analysis of where crimes happen in Chicago and how they are affected by various factors. The client(s) can include law enforcement, the government, or the residents of Chicago.

It's important to know the pattern of crimes in the city and how they are affected by other factors. For law enforcement, they would be able to allocate their limited resources more effectively by sending officers to where they are likely needed the most. While crime pattern analysis is useful, the factors that contribute/affect where and what kind of crimes happen are important as well. These factors can include but not limited to: weather, income level, time of the day, public transit, poverty levels, unemployment, school closings, and demographics. If there is a correlation between crimes and one or more of these factors, actions can be taken to mitigate the situation if possible. With regards to local residents, the analysis can be useful for them to avoid certain areas during a certain time period especially when public transit stops are invovled.
